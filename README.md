# PyBer_Analysis

## Analysis Overview

The goal of this project was to analysis the Pyber ride sharing data in order to gain a deeper understanding of ride & fare metrics broken down by the types of cities Pyber operates in. Various visualizations were created to portray the data properly in an effort to improve overall performance at Pyber by identifying opportunities and strengths.

## Results

The primary findings from the above data:

-	Urban city types have the most total rides by a significant margin. Rural has the least.
-	Urban cities also have a significant number more drivers than Suburban and Rural combined.
-	Urban has the highest Total Fares but it is only 50% higher than Suburban total fares even though there are nearly 6 times as many Urban drivers compared to Suburban.
-	Rural cities have the higher Average Fare per Ride and also highest Average Fare per Driver.
-	The summary seems to coincide with the basic premise of supply and demand. The higher the supply the lower the cost and vice versa.

## Summary

Further analysis would be required for a complete conclusion (such as average wait time, cancelled ride requests, competition impact etc) but it appears that both Rural and Suburban cities would benefit from more drivers. But, since demand is more likely fairly low in rural areas it seems the primary target for expansion should be Suburban areas. Any significant increase in drivers in rural areas would reduce average fare & fare per driver but more than likely lead to high idle times for drivers. Suburban offers the best expansion for both reducing costs for the customer and increasing profits for Pyber. More analysis would be required on the length of trip and potential high demand times in Rural areas to ensure that any push in driver count would be profitable.
